 * SceneLib2 is an open-source C++ library for SLAM originally designed and
 * implemented by Andrew Davison and colleagues at the University of Oxford.
 *
 * I reimplemented his version with the following objectives;
 *  1. Understand his MonoSLAM algorithm in code level.
 *  2. Replace older libraries (i.e. VW34, GLOW, VNL, Pthread) with newer ones
 *     (Pangolin, Eigen3, Boost).
 *  3. Support USB camera instead of IEEE1394.
 *  4. Make it more portable and convenient by using CMake and git repository.
